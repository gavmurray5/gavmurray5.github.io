          <h1>The Historic 2023 NL MVP Race in the MLB</h1>

          <p>After a season filled with many surprises, the 2023 Major League Baseball Campaign has officially come to a close. Thrilling comebacks, memorable postseason games, and a lop-sided World Series highlighted the year. One of the biggest stories, however, came from five of the games’ very best players: Ronald Acuna Jr, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, Matt Olson, and Corbin Carroll. This elite group battled against one another to give fans the most competitive MVP race baseball fans have seen in quite some time. The National Leauge featured a flurry of talent with promising rookies being called up throughout the year and rock-steady veterans still proving their worth to a franchise. It also had a more competitive playoff race than the American League did, proving to be the more entertaing conference in Major League Baseball this season.</p>
            
          <p>This article will be a statistical analysis of the performances that each of these players put up this past year. In addition to this, comparisons will be made with another era of the game where the nation was “in love” with the game of baseball again after years of mediocrity. In the end, the burning question will be if the voters made the right decision or not. Ronald Acuna Jr. ultimately won the award, but is there an argument to be made for the other four players? Was Acuna the right choice, or was another candidate robbed of the honor?</p>

        <h1>Comparing the Candidates</h1>
        <p>A closer look at the 5 players who all had a shot</p>

      <p>This year’s sprint to the finish line featured several standout names. Ronald Acuna Jr. was a feel good story for any sports fan. 2 years ago, Acuna suffered a season-ending ACL tear in Miami, which derailed what could’ve been an anonymous MVP in his catalog. The following year, he struggled at the plate, with many experts and fans questioning if he’d ever be the same player again. Acuna silenced the doubters, going on to have 41 homers, 217 total hits, and 73 stolen bases, an MLB record. He also helped lead the Braves to the best record in all of baseball.</p>

      <p>Acuna’s teammate, Matt Olson, also chipped in during a historic season in Atlanta. The power-hitting first baseman clobbered 54 home runs and drove in 139 runs, leading all of baseball in both categories. Olson was also awarded his first career silver slugger, an honor given out to the best offensive player at each position.</p>

      <p>Freedie Freeman has been no stranger to chasing MVP honors, as he won the award in 2020. The 34-year-old showed no signs of regression this past season, racking up 90 extra-base hits and scoring 131 runs, both career highs for the Dodgers’ first baseman. Freeman led the NL in intentional walks with 12, indicating that he was incredibly tough to get out this past year.</p>

      <p>Mookie Betts also brought tremendous production to the Dodgers’ lineup alongside Freeman. Betts was selected to his seventh all-star game and won his sixth slugger award, crushing a career-high 39 home runs for Los Angeles. His on-base percentage of nearly 41 percent was among the highest in all of baseball.</p>

      <p>What might’ve been one of the more impressive stories this year was Corbin Carroll, who had an incredible rookie season. The young outfielder led the Arizona Diamondbacks to their first World Series appearance since 2001, stealing 54 bases and leading the National League with 10 triples. He would easily run away with the NL Rookie of the Year award while also being named to the All Star Game.</p>

      <p>The voting committee certainly had their work cut out for them in making a decision. A great mix of young playmakers and proven veterans shaped out the field for the MVP. Not only did these players pave the way for the future of baseball, but it also reminded the older fans of how entertaining the game can really get.</p>

   

      <h2>The 1998 NL MVP race in comparison to this year</h2>
      <p>2023 reached the same competiveness of the "Steriod Era"</p>

    <p>It’s been a while since the league has seen an MVP race as competitive as this one. In years past, there has typically been a run-away candidate who blows past the rest of the competition. This year was different, however, and according to statistics expert Megan Carroll, this race rivaled one that took place 25 years ago.</p>

    <p>“When looking at the data, I couldn’t help but think back to the ‘Steroid Era’ of baseball,” said Megan, who was a big Yankees fan growing up. “It brought more attention to a sport that many believe was on the downfall."</p>

    <p>Megan brings up a very interesting point. Baseball has been regarded as a “dying sport” for the last few decades, with many believing that it will never reach the level of popularity that the MLB and NFL are at. The “Steroid Era,” which ran from 1994 to 2004, featured several players who were casually hitting 60 to 70 home runs in a season, something that seems impossible to do now.</p>

    <p>The 1998 season featured one of the most memorable MVP races in any sport, ever. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa each put together jaw-dropping seasons and also battled for the MVP and the home run title for 1998. What made it even more entertaining was that McGwire and Sosa both played in the same division, with McGwire playing for the St. Louis Cardinals and Sosa playing for the Chicago Cubs.</p>

    </script>
    
    
    

      <p>Sosa would end up taking home the NL MVP, slugging 66 homers with 158 runs batted in. McGwire would fall short in second place, even though he had 70 home runs and an on-base percentage of almost 50 percent. Years later, McGwire admitted to the public that he used steroids to set the home run record during his 1998 campaign.</p>

      <p>While the numbers weren’t as ridiculous as the 1998 season, the 2023 campaign still helped with the viewership and ratings of the sport. The attendance even increased, jumping 9.6 percent, the highest it’s been since 2017. The anticipation of who would come out on top for the NL MVP seemed to be winning fans over and giving them love for the game again.</p>


      <h3>Did the voters get it right?</h3>
      <p>Was Ronald Acuna Jr. deserving of MVP, or was someone robbed?</p>

    <p>A few days after the season concluded, it would officially be announced that Ronald Acuna Jr. won the National League Most Valuable Player award for the 2023 season. After the announcement, several baseball fans took to the internet to voice out their opinions, with many claiming that someone else should have won the award. Sure, Acuna might not have led the league in homeruns or batting average, but according to the stats, he added the most value to the team. His production offensively and defensively was able to win the voters over in the end.</p>

    <p>Acuna led the National League in offensive WAR, total hits, on-base percentage, and OPS. His 168 runs created led the NL by a wide margin and only committed five errors on defense in 162 games played. On top of his NL MVP, Acuna also took home the TSN Major League Player of the Year award, which honors the best all-around player in baseball.</p>

    <p>While Acuna looked deserving of MVP, an argument could have easily been made for the other candidates as well. Matt Olson led the NL in at-bats per home run and had a slugging percentage of 60 percent. Olson’s power numbers rivaled Giancarlo Statnton’s NL MVP season in 2017 for the Miami Marlins when he hit 59 home runs. Mookie Betts had more home runs and runs batted in this year than he did in his 2018 AL MVP year with the Boston Red Sox. Betts finished in second in MVP voting this year behind Acuna.</p>
