  <h1>Acuña or Betts? Here's what MVP poll says</h1>

  <h2>The MVP races in baseball for 2023 have been incredibly competitve thus far. Let's break down the top candidates and who has the best shot of winning the award</h2>

  <p>The race is suddenly a coin flip. Acuña once looked like he'd run away with the MVP trophy, but Betts just might seize it with his second-half charge.</p>

  <p>We're headed for a photo finish. Just look at the latest MLB.com MVP poll. It's the closest one ever. Only two votes separated Betts and Acuña in the NL.</p>

  <p>MLB.com's experts were asked to rank their top five MVP candidates in each league based on what's happened so far this season and what they expect will happen in the final month. Players received vote points on a 5-4-3-2-1 scale -- five points for a first-place vote, four points for a second-place vote and so on. Fifty-four voters participated in this edition of the poll.</p>

  <p>Ohtani has been the unanimous No. 1 choice for AL MVP in each of the previous MLB.com polls during the second half. Even after suffering a torn UCL that ended his season as a pitcher -- but not as a hitter -- the two-way superstar has accomplished so much this year that he's still the overwhelming favorite. Ohtani leads the AL with 44 home runs and leads the Majors with a 1.066 OPS. His final numbers on the mound for 2023: 10-5 with a 3.14 ERA and 167 strikeouts.</p>

  <p>Seager is leading the AL batting race with a .339 average and he also has 28 home runs, 84 RBIs and a 1.049 OPS. This is the best season of his career, and the four-time All-Star has had plenty of great seasons. Now if only Seager can slug the Rangers into the playoffs.</p>

  <p>J-Rod has come on strong in the second half and is now in the "MVP finalist" category after not even receiving a single top-five vote in the last MLB.com poll. He's up to 27 home runs and 36 stolen bases, putting him in position for his first 30-30 season, and he might win a Gold Glove in center field, too.</p>

  <p>Having Tucker in the middle of the order is one of the biggest reasons why the Astros have been able to take back first place in the AL West from Seager's Rangers and Rodríguez's Mariners. Tucker is batting .290 with 26 home runs, 26 stolen bases and 99 RBIs as the three teams and their MVP candidates battle it out down the stretch.</p>

  <p>The Rays are staying firmly in playoff position in large part thanks to Díaz's consistency. The slugger finished 20th in AL MVP voting last season, and he's sure to finish even higher this year. Díaz is batting .317 with 18 homers, 67 RBIs and an .891 OPS.</p>
